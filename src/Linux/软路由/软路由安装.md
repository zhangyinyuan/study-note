# 软路由安装


## 修改静态IP
> 特别注意，要添加网关，否则无法上网，ping外网不通
> 特别注意，要添加dns，否则无法解析域名
> 网关指向主路由IP 192.168.1.1(每个路由器可能不同，可以手机连接WIFI，网络详细中查看)

`vi /etc/config/network`,找到 config interface 'lan' 部分，按以下格式调整成自己的信息

```shell
config interface 'lan'
        option type 'bridge'
        option ifname 'eth0'
        option proto 'static'
        option ipaddr '192.168.1.100'
        option netmask '255.255.255.0'
        option gateway '192.168.1.1'
        option ip6assign '60'
        option dns '192.168.1.1'
        option dns '8.8.8.8'
```

修改好之后， 重启网络 `service network restart`



然后查看路由，没看到网关**192.128.1.1**，表示网关没有添加

```shell
root@OpenWrt:~# route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 br-lan
root@OpenWrt:~# ip route
192.168.1.0/24 dev br-lan proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.100
```

临时添加网关测试，如果能上网，通过修改`/etc/config/network`配置持久化即可

```shell
root@OpenWrt:~# ip route add default via 192.168.1.1
root@OpenWrt:~# route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
0.0.0.0         192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 br-lan
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 br-lan
root@OpenWrt:~# ip route
default via 192.168.1.1 dev br-lan proto static
192.168.1.0/24 dev br-lan proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.100
root@OpenWrt:~# ping baidu.com

```



## `opkg update`报错解决

```shell
 rm -rf /etc/opkg/*
```

`/etc/opkg.conf`内容如下：

```shell

## samba模板配置备份
```properties
[global]
	netbios name = |NAME| 
	interfaces = |INTERFACES|
	server string = |DESCRIPTION|
	unix charset = |CHARSET|
	workgroup = |WORKGROUP|

	## This global parameter allows the Samba admin to limit what interfaces on a machine will serve SMB requests.
	bind interfaces only = yes

	## time for inactive connections to-be closed in minutes
	deadtime = 15

	## disable core dumps
	enable core files = no

	## set security (auto, user, domain, ads)
	security = user

	## This parameter controls whether a remote client is allowed or required to use SMB encryption.
	## It has different effects depending on whether the connection uses SMB1 or SMB2 and newer:
    ## If the connection uses SMB1, then this option controls the use of a Samba-specific extension to the SMB protocol introduced in Samba 3.2 that makes use of the Unix extensions.
	## If the connection uses SMB2 or newer, then this option controls the use of the SMB-level encryption that is supported in SMB version 3.0 and above and available in Windows 8 and newer. 
	## (default/auto,desired,required,off)
	#smb encrypt = default

	## set invalid users
	invalid users = root

	## map unknow users to guest
	map to guest = Bad User

	## allow client access to accounts that have null passwords. 
	null passwords = yes

	## The old plaintext passdb backend. Some Samba features will not work if this passdb backend is used. (NOTE: enabled for size reasons)
	## (tdbsam,smbpasswd,ldapsam)
	passdb backend = smbpasswd

	## Set location of smbpasswd ('smbd -b' will show default compiled location)
	#smb passwd file = /etc/samba/smbpasswd 

	## LAN (IPTOS_LOWDELAY TCP_NODELAY) WAN (IPTOS_THROUGHPUT) WiFi (SO_KEEPALIVE) try&error for buffer sizes (SO_RCVBUF=65536 SO_SNDBUF=65536)
	socket options = IPTOS_LOWDELAY TCP_NODELAY

	## If this integer parameter is set to a non-zero value, Samba will read from files asynchronously when the request size is bigger than this value.
	## Note that it happens only for non-chained and non-chaining reads and when not using write cache.
	## The only reasonable values for this parameter are 0 (no async I/O) and 1 (always do async I/O).
	## (1/0)
	#aio read size = 0
	#aio write size = 0

	## If Samba has been built with asynchronous I/O support, Samba will not wait until write requests are finished before returning the result to the client for files listed in this parameter.
	## Instead, Samba will immediately return that the write request has been finished successfully, no matter if the operation will succeed or not.
	## This might speed up clients without aio support, but is really dangerous, because data could be lost and files could be damaged. 
	#aio write behind = /*.tmp/

	## lower CPU useage if supported and aio is disabled (aio read size = 0 ; aio write size = 0)
	## is this still broken? issue is from 2019 (NOTE: see https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14095 )
	## (no, yes)
	#use sendfile = yes

	## samba will behave as previous versions of Samba would and will fail the lock request immediately if the lock range cannot be obtained.
	#blocking locks = No

	## disable loading of all printcap printers by default (iprint, cups, lpstat)
	load printers = No
	printcap name = /dev/null

	## Enabling this parameter will disable Samba's support for the SPOOLSS set of MS-RPC's.
	disable spoolss = yes

	## This parameters controls how printer status information is interpreted on your system.
	## (BSD, AIX, LPRNG, PLP, SYSV, HPUX, QNX, SOFTQ)
	printing = bsd

	## Disable that nmbd is acting as a WINS server for unknow netbios names
	#dns proxy = No

	## win/unix user mapping backend
	#idmap config * : backend = tdb

	## Allows the server name that is advertised through MDNS to be set to the hostname rather than the Samba NETBIOS name.
	## This allows an administrator to make Samba registered MDNS records match the case of the hostname rather than being in all capitals.
	## (netbios, mdns)
	mdns name = mdns

	## Clients that only support netbios won't be able to see your samba server when netbios support is disabled.
	#disable netbios = Yes

	## Setting this value to no will cause nmbd never to become a local master browser.
	#local master = no

	## (auto, yes) If this is set to yes, on startup, nmbd will force an election, and it will have a slight advantage in winning the election. It is recommended that this parameter is used in conjunction with domain master = yes, so that nmbd can guarantee becoming a domain master. 
	#preferred master = yes

	## (445 139) Specifies which ports the server should listen on for SMB traffic.
	## 139 is netbios/nmbd
	#smb ports = 445 139

	## This is a list of files and directories that are neither visible nor accessible.
	## Each entry in the list must be separated by a '/', which allows spaces to be included in the entry. '*' and '?' can be used to specify multiple files or directories as in DOS wildcards.
	veto files = /Thumbs.db/.DS_Store/._.DS_Store/.apdisk/

	## If a directory that is to be deleted contains nothing but veto files this deletion will fail unless you also set the delete veto files parameter to yes.
	delete veto files = yes

################ Filesystem and creation rules ################
	## reported filesystem type (NTFS,Samba,FAT)
	#fstype = FAT

	## Allows a user who has write access to the file (by whatever means, including an ACL permission) to modify the permissions (including ACL) on it.
	#dos filemode = Yes

	## file/dir creating rules
	#create mask = 0666
